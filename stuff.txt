Some things I've done:• Created a Bluetooth audio receiver using a Raspberry Pi, C, and a few shell scripts• Created a webserver and associated iPhone app to control the led light strips in my room using a custom circuit, said Raspberry Pi, C, and Objective-C• Wrote a program that takes the music I'm listening to and makes the lights respond to the music using C• Wrote this website in JavaScript :)
